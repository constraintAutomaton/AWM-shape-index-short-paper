\section{Preliminary results}
We have implemented the containment algorithm describe in the previous section 
\footnote{The \href{https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/query-shape-detection}{algorithm} and an 
\href{https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/comunica-feature-link-traversal/tree/feature/shapeIndex}{integration} 
in the \href{https://github.com/comunica/comunica}{Comunica} query engine are open source can be access via the hypermedia links}.
In it's current state the algorithm doesn't support \href{https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#propertypaths}{SPARQL property path}, nested queries
and the dynamic analysis describe in the previous section. 
We use Solidbench \cite{Taelman2023} to compare our approach with the current state of the art.
To accomodate the limitation of our implementation we use a subset of the queries of Solidbench
\footnote{ We use interactive-short 1 and 5, interactive-discover 1,3-7 and interactive-complex 8}
\footnote{We modify the benchmark by adding shape index inside each "pod" of the benchmark.
The \href{https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/rdf-dataset-fragmenter.js/tree/feature/shapeIndex}{generator} of those index can be  can be access via the hypermedia link
}.
We executed each queries 50 times with a timeout of 1 minute (6,000 ms) 
\footnote{The \href{https://github.com/constraintAutomaton/amw_shape_index_results}{benchmark and complemantary results} are available in the hypermedia link}.
The results are presented at the figure \ref{fig:result}, the results of the complexe queries are not shown because both approach 
were not able to finish the execution before the timeout.
We can notice that in the worst case our approach (in blue) have similar query execution time with a distribution that tend to be
lower than the state of the art. Also the variance tend to be lower than the state of the art. 
A possible explanation is that the HTTP request tend to impredictatable which could cause the increase of variance.
In the best case

    The results of our approach are in blue and the state of the type index with LDP (the state of the art) in red.
    The results have been generated with 50 repetitions and a timeout of 6000 ms.
