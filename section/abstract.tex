    % Context
    Linked Data on the Web can be considered as one very large Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
    % Need
    Querying this DKG in a link traversal-based manner is difficult due to the pseudo-infinite size of the Web,
    its unstructured nature,
    and the lack of a priori information for query planning.
    \rt{Make it explicit that the huge number of links and query planning form the main bottlenecks of link traversal.}
    In practice, queries target small subsets of the Web.
    Most of those subsets are structured either implicitly or explicitly.
    Explicit structure can be described via hypermedia descriptions.
    Using those structural information query engines can improve
    their performances.\rt{How so? By reducing the search scope.}
    % Task
    Our goal is to explore the opportunities for using shape-based structural metadata within decentralized environments
    to improve discovery and query planning for traversal-based queries.
    \rt{You may want to explain what this shape-based metadata would look like in a few words, e.g. through an example, because it's too vague now. But keep it very short.}
    % Object
    In this article, we discuss these opportunities, present preliminary results, and discuss potential future work.
    % Findings
    Our initial experiments show that with little maintenance and work from the server,
    our method can more selectively discover data\rt{I would slightly rephrase this, and say that we can significantly reduce the number of links to be followed},
    leading to significant reductions in query execution time compared to the current state of the art.
    % Perspectives
    In future work, we are going to formalize our method, perform more extensive experiments,
    and design algorithms for query planning that take into account this shape metadata.
