\section{Conclusion}
Our approach for shape-based optimization of LTQP over LDSE consists of exploiting the structure provided of
annotated data sources with RDF shape metadata. We propose the usage of a shape index.
A shape index maps the content of a subdomain of the web with an RDF shape. We propose to solve
a shape query containment problem analogous to a query containment problem for dynamic source selection
using an adaptative lookup policy. 
Our early experiment shows that this approach can significantly reduce the query execution time and the number of HTTP request.
In future work, we will propose a featureful implementation of our containment algorithm and provide a more
detailed analysis of the performance of the method. We also intend to explore how to use RDF 
shape in LTQP for query planning and IRI dereferencing prioritization.
