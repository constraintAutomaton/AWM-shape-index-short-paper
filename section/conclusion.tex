    Given the expressiveness of RDF data shapes language~\cite{Delva2021, staworko_et_al:LIPIcs:2015:4985, 10.1007/978-3-319-68288-4_7} and practice in shape definitions~\cite{lieber_iswc_poster_2020, staworko_et_al:LIPIcs:2015:4985, Staworko2018ContainmentOS}.

The shape index approach shows that more precise source selection in LTQP can significantly reduce query execution time.
It is still an early effort, but we think that a solution inspired by our approach could be beneficial for the query and publication of fragmented document-based linked data.
The solution does not require extensive computational power from the data publisher during queries and updates~\sepfootnote{noChangeDataModel} of data sources.
Additionally, we believe that using a shape index could help improve the data quality of fragmented document-based linked data.
There are still multiple questions left to be answered such as how to handle private data, what is the overhead and complexity of the method~\sepfootnote{complexity},
can the shape index alone or with other data summarisation structures be used to improve query planning without sacrificing query execution times?
