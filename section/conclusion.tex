\section{Conclusion}
Our approach for shape-based optimization for LTQP over decentralized environments consists of exploiting the structure provided by
annotated data sources with RDF shape metadata. 
We propose the usage of a shape index as a metadata descriptor.
This shape index maps subdomain of the web with an RDF shape validating its content.
We propose to solve a query shape containment problem analogous to the classic query containment problem for dynamic source selection
using an adaptative lookup policy. 
Our early experiment shows that this approach can significantly reduce the query execution time and the number of HTTP requests.
In future work, we will propose a featureful implementation of our containment algorithm and provide a more
detailed explanation of the approach and the analysis of the performance of the method.
Furthermore, we intend to explore the usage of RDF shape in the context of LTQP for query planning and IRI dereferencing prioritization.
