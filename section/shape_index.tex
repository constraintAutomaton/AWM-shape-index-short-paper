\section{Shape index and query shape containment}

We define a Shape Index (SI) as a set of mappings between RDF shapes and sets of resources.
Additionally, an SI has an associated domain of action
and a flag indicating if each resource in the domain is bound by a shape. 
We refer to a SI with this flag as a \emph{complete} Shape Index.
In a SI when a shape is in relation to a set of RDF resources then the shape must validate those resources.
Furthermore, every set of triples respecting the shape in the domain must be located inside one resource of the set.
Lastly, if the shape has an RDF class constraint
then every set of triples associated with that class must respect the shape.
The last proposition implies that in the domain of a shape index, there cannot be a contradiction
between the class definition and the shape definition and neither can there be "partial entities" if they
are bound by a class.
