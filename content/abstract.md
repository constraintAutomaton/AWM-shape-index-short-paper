## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
The world wide web of linked data can be considered as one big structured database.
<!-- Need         -->
Its querying is difficult due to the pseudo-infinite size of the web and the lack of standardized a priorio information
for query engine optimization.
<!-- Task         -->
Because most queries over the web implicitly target a small unknown subdomain we
can exploit information given by the data provider to define this sudomain and optimize the query processing.
<!-- Object       -->
We propose to introduce a shape index to improve discoverability, quality of data and query processing.
<!-- Findings     -->
With our early experiment, we show that with our method can more easily
discover data on the web and greatly reduce the query execution time by adapting
dynamically query engine lookup policy.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Those result indicates that if the data publisher describes precisely the content and location of its data
and if the user creates selective enough query then LTQP might be viable querying method in web decentralized environment.
<!-- Perspectives -->
In future work we are going to formalize our method, evaluate it with more queries and environment and experiment if we can improve query plan and the speed the users get the results.
