## Abstract
<!-- Context      -->
Linked Data on the Web can be considered as one very large Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG).
<!-- Need         -->
Querying this DKG in a link traversal-based manner is difficult due to the pseudo-infinite size of the Web,
its unstructured nature,
and the fact that query engines have no a priori information for query planning.
In practice, queries target small subsets of the Web.
Most of those subsets have structure either implicit or explicit.
The explicit structure can be declared with the path structure of the
URL or with hypermedia description.
Using those structural information query engines can improve
their query performances.
<!-- Task         -->
Our goal is to explore the opportunities for using shape-based structural metadata within decentralized environments
to improve discovery and query planning for traversal-based queries.
<!-- Object       -->
In this article, we discuss these opportunities, present preliminary results, and discuss potential future work.
<!-- Findings     -->
Our initial experiments show that with little maintenance and work from the server
our method can more selectively discover data,
leading to significant reductions in query execution time compared to the current state of the art.
<!-- Conclusion   -->
Our preliminary results demonstrate the benefits of shape-based metadata when querying over decentralized environments.
<!-- Perspectives -->
In future work, we are going to formalize our method, perform more extensive experiments,
and design algorithms for query planning that take into account this shape metadata.
